    Performs the in-projection step of the attention operation, using packed weights.
    Output is a triple containing projection tensors for query, key and value.

    Args:
        q, k, v: query, key and value tensors to be projected. For self-attention,
            these are typically the same tensor; for encoder-decoder attention,
            k and v are typically the same tensor. (We take advantage of these
            identities for performance if they are present.) Regardless, q, k and v
            must share a common embedding dimension; otherwise their shapes may vary.
        w: projection weights for q, k and v, packed into a single tensor. Weights
            are packed along dimension 0, in q, k, v order.
        b: optional projection biases for q, k and v, packed into a single tensor
            in q, k, v order.

    Shape:
        Inputs:

        - w: :math:`(E * 3, E)` where E is the embedding dimension
        - b: :math:`E * 3` where E is the embedding dimension

        Output:
        - in output list :math:`[q', k', v']`, each output tensor will have the
            same shape as the corresponding input tensor.
